    "content": "<p>Here are some things I learnt in 2020:</p><p><strong>I am less emotionally vacant than I thought I was</strong>: Dad being ill really shook me, particularly when he went in for his second open heart surgery. Potentially losing Mari opened the flood gates even though I had rationalised it. Bobby getting lost made me sick to my stomach and felt like I had almost lost a child.</p><p><strong>I am incredibly fortunate and most of that stems from things out of my control </strong>(e.g. where I was born). Seeing the hardship of our cleaner and how Colombia offers her zero support was eye opening. She has had to deal with clients just stopping contact with her during quarantine, an ill husband, a niece with cancer, family without jobs and various other challenges. </p><p><strong>What being a better partner is</strong>. Loving Mari for who she is rather than how close she is to some utopic ideal of what a partner should be. This stems from overoptimization too. My ideal for a partner was XYZ but that ideal left for no serendipity. Mari is wonderful in many ways I had never thought about and I am better for it. So I learnt that holding on to your utopic ideals is terrible not only because it is unrealistic and shallow but also because it is flawed as it is limited by your experience.</p><p><strong>How hard life in Colombia is and how lucky I am that I can choice where I live</strong>. Colombians put up with so much friction and crap that limits you but is out of your control. It makes you feel impotent and demotivated. I already feel the shackles loosening a bit as I start my move home. That said, I have loved Colombia and will miss it dearly. Bogotá has been a home to me and I have had a lovely life there. I met Mari and found Mango in Colombia. It will be forever in my heart. I had amazing moments and I didn't even scratch the surface. I feel lucky that I have the choice to move to other places and hope that highlighting the luck I have is taken as the recognition that it is rather than a boast or a slight.</p><p><strong>The people I admire and aspire to online (mainly on Twitter) actually probably spend too much time there</strong>. Having a big presence online for the most part requires prioritising online over offline. I don't want my life to mostly exist online therefore I shouldn't covet them.</p><p>Things go full circle and <strong>you constantly forget the things you have learnt</strong>. Routines, mindsets and experiences that previously helped and solved problems for you can easily be forgotten as the problems they have solved disappear. Journaling can help remind you of your habits in the good times so you don't forget why something you do is important.</p><p><strong>Life is much more fragile than you realise</strong>. Dad nearly died multiple times growing up in Belfast. Last year his health was turned upside down overnight. The coronavirus came and demolished the way we live. Trump nearly mutilated American democracy. Churchill lamented in 1905 that him and his fellow soldiers would never see war again then fought in two of the most significant in history. Humanity survives on a precipice yet its constant advancement makes us complacent. Life as we know it is absolutely not a constant. Ever improving quality of life is just the latest iteration of a lost past. Do not take a single second of it for granted.</p><p><strong>Health is important and will only get worse</strong>. Mum and Dad will only get more ill from here. Mari and I will only get less healthy. The impact comes not only from the illness but from the restrictions it places you under.</p>",

For past purchases I will use the Amazon order history downloads I already have, for future purchases I would like a webhook to auto populate the list based on the emails received from Amazon. Ideally I would also incorporate my Amazon wishlists and some sort of recommendations tracker where I can add a book name and the person who recommends it (maybe to a spreadsheet) and the rest of the process is done automatically.</p><p><strong>Information Aggregator</strong>: A place to store good quality information sources, perhaps as links, or perhaps as feeds. If a link list, then the list should reorder based on the number of times I open publications.</p><p><strong>Now page on my website</strong>: Like Derek Sivers, I would like a page on my site that records what I am currently working on. Ideally this would be to promote focus and also as an interesting way to get buy in on things I am working on as I build an audience</p><p><strong>Simple email for creators</strong>: A simple, low cost email service that allows creators to have multiple emails based of their domain. E.g book@henryblack.co.uk etc. Some service that makes it super easy for solo creators to manage this, aggregate emails and reply from different domains.</p><p><strong>A script to auto download analytics data</strong>: then aggregate and visualise it. I am sure there are services that do this already but it would be nice to build my own and create a way of auto-updating a page on my site. (Check out what levels.io does to populate his)</p><p><strong>Set up and host my own api</strong> for various projects I will work on. Routes for data analysis (e.g. send array of stock prices in and get stats out, book data fetching when sending in title, general automation of tasks).</p><p><strong>Do an analysis of ROCE for FTSE 100 companies</strong>: and see if there is any price predicatbility. Backtest a portfolio of the 10 companies with the highest ROCE v the benchmark.</p><p><strong>Online version of high card gats</strong>: live version of the card game using websockets</p><p><strong>Locale changer</strong>: a web extension that allows users to quickly switch browser locale to test different websites</p>",

    "content": "<p>I have spent some time reflecting on 2020. Whilst it was a year tainted by global events, it was a great year for me personally. </p><p>Here are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HAJBlack/status/1344743367255740416?s=20\">some photos from the year</a>. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HAJBlack/status/1344742404591669250?s=20\">some things I am thankful for</a>:</p><p>I have big plans for 2021 and I am going to post them publicly here to hold me accountable and help clarify them.</p><p><strong>Dramatically improve myself as a programmer</strong> - this was a goal for 2020 that I succeeded in. This year I want to continue the momentum, being more deliberate in my studies and particularly focusing on the stack I am working with at <a href=\"https://henryblack.co.uk/my-goals-for-2021/maze.design/\">Maze</a>. This goal will have two yardsticks:</p><ol><li>Each month I will assign myself a course on a specific topic, publish my progress and repeat (ideally using the new knowledge in a project). Here is a <a href=\"https://henryblack.co.uk/deliberate-learning-for-2021/\">list of areas</a> I want to improve in.</li><li>Each month I will complete and deploy a project (app, site, package) that pushes my ability and gets me better at building with the end goal of putting it live. <a href=\"https://henryblack.co.uk/projects-for-2021/\">Here is the list of projects</a>.</li></ol><p><strong>Build an audience</strong> - long term, I plan on supplementing my income through building and selling online products. A big part of this success (and really any success) will depend on building an audience. Some yardsticks:</p><ol><li>Building my Twitter following to 1k followers (currently 300). This is an arbitrary number so I am not going to hold myself to it strictly but rather focus on making more effort at publishing stuff I and my target audience find mutually interesting. I will not produce content purely for gaining followers as it doesn't reconcile with who I am.</li><li>Building an email list. I have already a decent list for my finance book but will look to build a more general list through my website and any frequent mailings I start.</li></ol><p><strong>Make everything public (and try selling it)</strong> - I am an information hoarder and a serial non-finisher. I build lots of cool things, write a lot and am generally inquisitive, however none of this public. This is bad because a) it would be useful for future career opportunities, b) it means I don't get to share it with other people who might like it and I miss the enjoyment/motivation that can bring, c) it means I don't finish stuff because motivation wanes. Yardsticks:</p><ol><li>Productize the stuff I build. This will give me motivation to finish it, teach me about selling online and get me more fluent in putting it an myself out there (hopefully killing off my crippling perfectionism).</li><li>Publish my book on investing. It is pathetic I have sat on it for so long and it lingers in the back of mind taking up working memory. Publish it, learn about the process and forget about it. Anything that comes from it is a bonus.</li></ol><p><strong>Read and write more</strong> - My reading the last few years has dropped despite having a great decade. I ended 2020 well, churning through a few books but I need to maintain momentum. Same for writing. I need to develop more of a habit so the process of taking something from idea to article is more enjoyable, informative and quicker. Yardsticks:</p><ol><li>Read more and create a system that promotes reading and keeps current and prospective reading front of mind. For books, create pages on my site that display my purchase history, reading stats, booknotes and wish lists. For articles, do the same.</li><li>Write more frequently on stuff I find interesting. Don't write for views as that doesn't motivate me. Embrace the process, starting very disjointed and throwing down a dump of ideas, then process and order them. From there, create an article. Default to putting the article live (but with a draft tag) and then come back to improve it later.</li><li>Invest some time on creating a system that helps with idea capture, processing and publication. Remove as much friction as possible and optimize gently.</li></ol><p><strong>Health</strong> - I am pretty active and am in decent enough shape. However, Dad getting ill in 2020 has hammered home that health is fleeting. My health and that of my families will only get worse from here. The altitude and relaxed lifestyle of Bogotá has been great for me and made it easy to stay active so when I move back to the UK in March I will need to be more deliberate about my health.</p><ol><li>Keep generally active. Use Mango and weekends away as an excuse to do more pleasurable forms of activity.</li><li>Research and try out a specific health related goal.

    "content": "<p>When I was setting up this blog, I ran into two issues related to users subscribing to my newsletter:</p><ol><li>For some reason, the sign-up form would throw an error when trying to subscribe with Gmail addresses and</li><li>The 'Confirm your subscription' emails were going to spam</li></ol><p>After lots of time going down rabbit holes, I finally found a solution and this post is going to walk you through it.</p><p>When you set up Ghost on your own server instance (i.e. not through Ghosts hosting solution), transactional emails use some default settings that aren't ideal. Even if you set up the Mailgun API for bulk email from the CMS, transactional emails are dealt with separately and require you to do some extra work.</p><p>In short, here is what you need to do:</p><ol><li>Check you have an <code>spf</code> record on your domain DNS</li><li>Update your <code>config.production.json</code> file on the server to send transactional emails via SMTP (here I use Mailgun as it is required for bulk email and is pretty easy to set up)</li></ol><p>Let's take a look at these two steps in more detail below but before we do, note that these steps are based on my own set up.  The below steps may vary if you are using different providers.</p><p>For refernce, I self-host Ghost using a Digital Ocen droplet and my email service provider is Mailgun (for both bulk and SMTP/transactional emails). </p><h3 id=\"step-1-add-an-spf-record-to-your-domain-dns\">Step 1: Add an SPF record to your domain DNS</h3><p>When you add an SPF record to your domain, you are effectively telling email services like Gmail and Yahoo that you have given your email service provider (e.g. Mailgun) permission to send emails from your domain. Without this, your emails will likely be flagged as spam and your users might never see the email.</p><p>To fix this, go to your domain host and check the DNS settings on your domain. Mailgun should have shown you how to do this when you set up your account with them but if not, you can see how mine looks below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://henryblack.co.uk/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-07-at-10.49.15.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"https://henryblack.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-07-at-10.49.15.png 600w, https://henryblack.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-07-at-10.49.15.png 1000w, https://henryblack.co.uk/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-07-at-10.49.15.png 1600w, https://henryblack.co.uk/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-07-at-10.49.15.png 1976w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>(Note, I am using a subdomain 'mg' to send emails from. This can be good practice so that your root domain doesn't get added to the spam list for whatever reason).</p><p>That is it. Obviously, if you use a different email service provide to Mailgun, you should change the <code>include=mailgun.org</code> part to reflect that provider.</p><h3 id=\"step-2-update-your-config-production-json-file\">Step 2: Update your <code>config.production.json</code> file</h3><p>This section involves a little more work. We now need to update our Ghost instance to send transactional emails via SMTP using Mailgun. Let's take it step by step.</p><p>First, you need to access your Ghost instance using SSH from your own terminal. If you don't have SSH set up, <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2\">check out this tutorial</a> from Digital Ocean.</p><p>In your terminal, SSH into your instance by running the following command:</p><p><code>ssh root@&lt;YOUR WEBSITE IP ADDRESS&gt;</code></p><p>( you can get your IP address from inside the Digital Ocean Dashboard by opening the droplet and copying the number next to <strong>ipv4</strong>)</p><p>Next, we need to go to the directory where Ghost is installed:<br><code>cd /var/www/ghost</code></p><p>Here is our config file and we need to edit it using Vim:</p><p><code>vim config.production.json</code></p><p>Once the file has opened, hit <code>i</code> to enter insert mode so you can start editing it.</p><p>Here we have to update the mail settings in the config file to use SMTP and the credentials from our Mailgun account. To do that, you need two pieces of data from Mailgun:</p><ol><li><strong>Your SMTP login</strong>: normally <a>postmaster@yourdomain.com</a> (to find it, click 'Sending' in the left panel, then 'Domain Settings', then go to the SMTP Credentials Tab)</li><li><strong>Your API Key</strong>: shown as your 'Private API key' in the Account Security page</li></ol><p>Going back to terminal, you need to update your config file to the following (adding your own user and pass details):</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"mail\": {\n    \"transport\": \"SMTP\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"service\": \"Mailgun\",\n      \"host\": \"smtp.mailgun.org\",\n      \"port\": 465,\n      \"secureConnection\": true,\n      \"auth\": {\n        \"user\": \"postmaster@&lt;YOUR DOMAIN&gt;\",\n        \"pass\": \"&lt;YOUR API KEY&gt;\"\n      }\n    }\n  },</code></pre><p>Note that the port is 465. This is different from what the official Ghost docs suggest. I followed the Ghost docs first and it didn't work until I went with 465. H/T this <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/t/help-with-email-subs-via-mailgun/15159/5\">forum response</a> by the user morgan which saved my ass here.</p><p>Save and exit from Vim by pressing <code>esc</code> then <code>wq</code> and hitting <code>enter</code>.</p><p>Finally, you need to restart Ghost by running the command <code>ghost restart</code>. If you are on the root user it will initially say that root users can't run commands but it goes ahead and does it anyway.</p><h3 id=\"finishing-up\">Finishing up</h3><p>With all that set up, transactional emails should now be working an emails shouldn't be headed to spam. </p><p>I hope you found this useful and that the numerous hours I lost working all this out will save you some time.</p><p>I will be regularly posting the steps I am going through as I try to build an online business so if you found this useful and are going through a similar process you can sign up below this article.</p><h4 id=\"useful-links-\">Useful Links:</h4><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/t/help-with-email-subs-via-mailgun/15159/5\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Help with email subs via mailgun</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">I’ve also been struggling with this issue a lot on the Perfect Product blog.

    "content": "<p>Javascript is a quirky old thing. It divides opinions like no other language, yet it is an integral part of the internet and therefore our lives. Having initially hated it and put off learning it for as long as humanly possible, I am now a doting fan. It's scars and wrinkles have turned to powerful beauty.</p><p>This article is going to look at one high level area:</p><ol><li>What exactly is happening when you run a piece of code in Javascript?</li></ol><p>Let's start with a piece of code:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function logger(message) {\n\tconsole.log(message)\n}\n\nlogger(\"Hello\")\n</code></pre><p>We all know that this will print 'Hello' to the console but what happens behind the scenes? For that, we need to understand the Javascript runtime.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598119188935/VrwjlGj-U.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"JS_Runtime.png\"></figure><p>Let's start with the execution context. The <strong>Global Execution Context</strong> is the name for the environment in which javascript parses, stores and executes code. It has two parts:</p><ul><li><strong>The Thread of Execution</strong> - this is where javascript parses the code line by line, in order.</li><li><strong>Global Variable Environment</strong> (or Global Memory) - this is where javascript stores all the variables and functions that it encounters</li></ul><p>As Javascripts thread of execution parses through our code it does one of two things:</p><ol><li>Stores code in the memory - resulting in a label and the stored piece of code (note: when storing the code, Javascript doesn't bother to read it. It just puts it in memory to be accessed later)</li><li>Executes code - this is where Javascript performs an action such as invoking a function. For this, a new Local Execution Context is added onto the call stack and the thread of execution enters the local context</li></ol><p>This brings to attention two points about Javascript:</p><blockquote>Javascript is <strong>single threaded</strong> and <strong>synchronous</strong></blockquote><p><strong>Single threaded:</strong> Javascript follows one single route through the code rather than taking multiple different routes simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Synchronous:</strong> Javascript processes code in the order that it is presented. Whilst it is processing the current line of code, all the other code has to wait until it is finished</p><p>Let's look at this the context of our code snippet:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598119203078/aEzx-FE7M.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"JS_Runtime_with_code.png\"></figure><p>The thread of execution will pass through our code line by line. The first line it sees is the function definition for logger. Without reading what is inside, Javascript will add that definition to memory under the variable name <code>logger</code>. Then the thread of execution will move on to the next line of code which is line 5. Here Javascript sees the variable name <code>logger</code> and checks the global memory to see if there is a variable saved with the same name. There is, so Javascript executes that code, passing in the argument <code>\"Hello\"</code>.</p><p>When the thread of execution invokes a function, Javascript creates what is called a local execution context.  The <strong>Local Execution Context</strong> or function level execution context is like a mini Global Execution Context. The thread of execution passes through this local context and can store data in its local memory (the local variable environment). Note: the local context can access the Global Memory but the Global Memory cannot access the Local Memory. This is known as <strong>scope</strong>. As your programs get more complex, you will likely have many execution contexts nested on top of each other. It's important to remember that that each execution context has access to their own memory and the memory of it's ancestors. When it looks for a variable, if it doesn't find it in it's own execution context Javascript will search the next execution context up and so on until it if finds the variable or throws an error.</p><p>The <strong>Callstack</strong> keeps track of which context the thread of execution is in. New local execution contexts (known as calls or frames) are pushed onto the stack and when completed they are popped off the stack and the thread of execution returns to the global context. The Callstack is LIFO: last in, first out like a stack of plates - the last one on is always the first on off.</p><p>Given that Javascript is synchronous, multiple blocks of code cannot be executed at the same time. To manage this, Javascript has two queues where asynchronous callbacks wait until the thread of execution is ready for them:</p><ul><li>The Callback queue (or task queue)</li><li>The Microtask queue</li></ul><p>The <strong>Callback Queue</strong> and the <strong>Microtask Queue</strong> are both FIFO: first in, first out. The Microtask queue has higher priority than the Callback queue so its callbacks are executed first. Callbacks from the Callback queue will only be pushed to the stack if the Microtask queue is empty which means too many callbacks in the Microtask queue can starve the callback queue and prevent its tasks from getting onto the callstack.</p><p>The Event Loop is responsible for deciding which callbacks are push onto the stack. It uses two criteria:</p><ol><li>Has all the code in the global context been executed?</li><li>Is the callstack empty?</li></ol><p>If these criteria are met, it will push callbacks onto the stack.</p><p>So which task makes it into which queue? There are nuances based on each Javascript runtime so let's take a broad brush and assume that we are in the browser.</p><p>There are thee main ways of adding to the Callback queue:</p><ol><li>Loading a script from your HTML</li><li>An event fires</li><li>Using <code>setTimout()</code> or <code>setInterval()</code></li></ol><p>For the Microtask queue, you have two options:</p><ol><li>Resolve or reject a promise</li><li>Use <code>window.queueMicrotask()</code> (although generally you wouldn't use this unless creating a library/framework)</li></ol><p>That was a whirlwind tour of the Javascript runtime. With this foundational mental model we can move on to learn about hoisting and async Javascript. Part 2 coming up.</p>",

    "title": "Why Should You Invest For The Long Term?",
    "content": "<p>It is often said that investors should invest for the long-term. But why? This post aims to look at how investors would have fared investing over differing periods. I will show you why investing for long periods gives you a better chance of success than investing over shorter periods.</p><p>When investors talk about investing over the long term or short term, they are referring to the amount of time that you leave your money invested before selling the investment. If I invested today and sold it tomorrow, that would be very, very short term. If I invested today and sold in 30 years, that would be considered long term.</p><p>Investing is inherently uncertain. No person can guarantee that today is a better day to invest than tomorrow will be. No-one can forecast the future with any degree of certainty. An investors job is therefore not to try and do the impossible task of predicting the future. An investors job is to try to tilt the odds in their favour. They hope to merely improve their chances of getting it right and reduce their chances of getting it wrong. Investing for longer is one of the ways of increasing your chances of getting it right. Let's do some analysis to see why:</p><p>To understand this better, we are going to look at the past and see how our investments would have performed. We are going to look at a range of different periods to see if certain periods give us a better chance of success than others. For example, if I had invested for 1 year, would my investments have performed better than if I had invested over 10 years.</p><p>We quickly run into problems here though. Which 1 year or 10 year period do we pick? The difference in return for a good 1 year period and a bad 1 year period will likely be huge and picking the wrong one could skew our results.</p><p>To avoid this, we want to look all the 1 year periods as far back as we have data for. We will start at the first data point we have and look at what our return would have been 1 year later. We then move on to the second data point we have and look at what our return would have been 1 year later. And so on until we have covered every single 1 year period over the time we have data for. By doing this, we can work out how many of those periods gave us positive returns and how many gave us negative returns. We can also look at the average, best and worst returns.</p><p>We will then repeat this whole process for a 3-year time horizon. And again for 5 years, 10 years and so on.</p><p>This is likely to get pretty boring and repetitive so I have written a python script to do all the hard work for us. Here I am using monthly data from the MSCI All Country World Index (Gross GBP).</p><p>Here are the results for a time period of 1 year:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6b14e4d802aeadd4a7842_Screenshot%202019-12-03%20at%2013.58.56.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Shown in %. Gross monthly data for the MSCI ACWI in GBP. Source: MSCI website</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, in the best 1 year period, the index returned over 63%. In it's worst year, it lost nearly 32%.</p><p>Now, lets add on the results for 10 years:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6b18c4a55392cb42d6e0f_Screenshot%202019-12-03%20at%2013.59.04.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Shown in %. Gross monthly data for the MSCI ACWI in GBP. Source: MSCI website</figcaption></figure><p>The best year got a lot better and the worst year got a lot less bad. The average return also shot up. Here we can see that investors who invest for 10 years, in the past, would have had a much better experience than those who invested over 1 year.</p><p>Here are the results up to 30 years:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6b4f6ed78f0277247effa_Screenshot%202019-12-03%20at%2014.17.38.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Shown in %. Gross monthly data for the MSCI ACWI in GBP. Source: MSCI website</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the longer you invest for, the better your chances of success. If you had invested for 15 years or more, you would have never lost money. This is no guarantee that you would not lose money in the future over 15 years. No-one knows the future. However, this data shows us that investing for longer periods <strong>improves your chances</strong> of a good result. That is all we can hope for as investors.</p><p>This data by itself is pretty ugly, so let's try and make it look a little bit nicer. Here is the same data as above, but shown as a graph. For each of our time horizons, we can see the best return (blue line), the worst return (orange line) and the average return (green line).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6c676015a1b404e4c1c21_best-worst-av.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Again, we see that the longer you invest for, the better the chance you have of a good result. The red line horizontal line indicates 0% returns so you can see that somewhere in between 10 - 15 years is the sweet spot where all returns where positive.</p><p>Whilst useful, the best, worst and average returns hide a lot of information. With just these three data points we can't tell if the best returns were just wild one-offs or whether the index frequently gave high returns. It would be useful to see all of the data in one chart to give us a more complete view. To do this, we will look at two areas:</p><ol><li>The percentage of positive and negative returns (using an area graph)</li><li>The range of returns (using histograms)</li></ol><p>Let's start with the first. Here I will write a script that looks at each of our time horizons and works out the percentage of the returns that were above 0% - 'up years' - and the percentage that were below or equal to 0% - 'down years'. Here are the results in a table:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6cdae4a55398fb239a0c0_Screenshot%202019-12-03%20at%2016.00.25.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Again, we see that longer-term is better. We also see that stocks are a fairly 'asymmetric' asset class. That is to say that their returns tend to be bigger than their risks.</p><p>Next, we will run the same analysis and put the info into a graph. For completeness, I am going to tweak the script to give us the results for every single year time-period. So rather than show 1 year, 3 years and so on, we will have the data for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years etc up until 30 years.<br></p><p>Here are the results:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6d9184aae0ada31966282_%25returns.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>The red area shows us the % of negative return years. The blue area shows us the % of positive return years. For example, when you look at the 1 Year results the graph tells us that just over 20% of the time stocks lost money. The rest of the time they made money.</figcaption></figure><p>Again, we see that stocks tend to make money more frequently than they lose it. We are also reminded that the longer you invest for, the better your chance of positive returns.</p><p>Whilst useful, this analysis is still hiding quite a lot of information. Next, we want to find a way to visualise all of the individual returns for each period. For example, it would be useful to see all the returns for every single one year period on one diagram. Histograms are pretty useful for this.</p><p>Below is a histogram for the 1-year returns. The histogram categorises and sorts the returns into buckets. It counts the number of returns that fall into each bucket making the height of the bar reflect the total. For example, in the histogram below you can see I have highlighted one of the bars with a yellow circle. This bar sits on the horizontal axis between 10% - 20%. The height of the bar shows the number of 1 year periods where the return was between 10% and 20% - over 100.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de6e7d8ee027c3dd6ed9228_1-year-hist.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This histogram shows us that over a one-year investment horizon, the returns investors made were mainly in the range of 10-20%. In fact, the majority of the bars, particularly the big ones are to the right of the 0% mark - shown by the red vertical line - meaning that the returns were generally positive. This is called positive skew and relates to what we said earlier: stocks tend to have asymmetric returns. Their returns are generally more positive than negative.</p><p>Let's look at this over varying time frames and see how the returns shape up. We are going to look at the returns spread for every single year up to 30 years. To make this a fair comparison, I have tweaked a few parameters such as changing the range of buckets and removing the gaps between the bars. This should hopefully make it easier to see the shape and compare between periods. I have also turned the results into a gif so you can easily see how the shape changes over time. Here it is:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5de710451deb852a2bc174d2_returns.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you can see, as soon as we hit the 11-year mark the returns are all positive (to the right of the red line) and the returns shoot off to the right, indicating much larger returns. This is past data, so who knows whether the future will be different. However, this shows us that as investors, the longer we can invest for the higher our chances of having a good experience and make decent returns.</p><p>Some points I might add in the future:</p><ul><li>Doing the same analysis but using inflation adjusted returns</li><li>Doing the same analysis but with a range of different asset classes</li></ul>",

    "content": "<p>I recently returned to Cúcuta, the humid border town that is the first stop for many Venezuelans fleeing the humanitarian crisis unfolding back home. This post looks at how the situation compares to my first visit almost a year earlier, as well as my experience at the Venezuela Aid Live Concert and the war-like scenes the following day.‍</p><p>As soon as I arrived in Bogotá in February 2018 it became apparent there was a crisis brewing over the border. Bogotá has long been a city where every day you see people living on the street and asking for money or 'una colaboración'. But when I arrived in that February I was struck by the number of families living on the street, looking lost and bewildered. There were no hallmarks of drug use or the imprinted dirt and soot that is unavoidable in life on Bogotá's pavements. This was new. These were families that had recently found themselves without money or homes.</p><p>It's a scene I have become all too familiar with and each day you feel the desperation of these people incrementally deepen. They have left their country, Venezuela, in search of a substitute they hope will be able to sustain them a little longer. For many, there was no choice in the matter. They either stayed and died of hunger or illness, or packed as much as they could carry and walked on in hope.</p><p>Shortly after arriving in Bogotá, I met Dylan Baddour (check out <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/DylanBaddour\">his Twitter</a>), a Texan journalist dedicated to reporting on the worsening situation in Venezuela. He spends much of his time in Cúcuta, the humid Colombian border town where many Venezuelans enter the country. He invited me to join him on his next trip as a quasi fixer.</p><p>‍At this point, the situation was already bad but it hadn't really gathered any international attention. Aid groups were just starting to realise there was a problem and Colombia was still working out its stance for managing the increasing number of migrants entering the country. However, the situation on the ground was already desperate. Cúcuta has three 'border bridges' where Venezuelans can cross into Colombia and vice-versa. The bridges make up an effectively open border, where you can just walk across without checks. Even if you ran into any issues on the bridge, you could just hop off the side and walk alongside the bridge and over the border. The often-wooded countryside between the border bridges is completely unmanned and unregulated by the authorities so armed militias, narco-traffickers and the like willingly fill that void. The migration officers don't care what happens off the bridge, it's not in their pay bracket. Venezuelan recyclers know this and take advantage of it. When they are stopped walking across the bridge with scrap metal to sell in Colombia, they just hop off the bridge and continue their search for earnings in a more dependable currency.</p><p>‍Before talking about the situation at the border back in April 2018 and my most recent visit almost a year later, it is worth looking at why these people are leaving their country. Colombia itself has problems, especially with homelessness, poverty and unemployment. Sadly, for most Venezuelans, Colombia's problems are nothing compared to what is unfolding at home in Venezuela.</p><p>‍Venezuela is one of the worlds few remaining socialist run countries. Socialism under their previous president, Hugo Chavez, brought wealth, prosperity, health, employment and general wellbeing to Venezuela's people before being succeeded by Nicolás Maduro in 2002. With the largest known oil reserves in the world, it succeeded in abating the issues that normally plague socialist nations who inevitably need to trade with outside countries for resources that are unattainable internally (see: Cuba). Cúcuta during this period was a playground for Venezuelans who wanted to hop the border to buy cheap goods with their strong currency. Shopkeepers on Cúcuta's high-street reminisce about Venezuelans arriving and buying 12 pairs of the same latest brand-name trainers or buying 5 of the latest laptops to take back for their family. Not only were they wealthy but well looked after. The healthcare system in Venezuela was exceptional (often aided by Cuba's renowned doctors). Employment was easy to find and the government provided you with the necessities to live.</p><p>‍Socialism, however, structurally requires a concentration of power that humans are not well suited too. Be it in capitalist markets, government or office politics, the side effects of over-concentrated power falling into incapable hands always outweighs the benefits. In Venezuela, this sorry dynamic has had generational impacts. Under the management of Nicolás Maduro, both incompetence and systemic corruption have vaporised Venezuela's economic prosperity. With the majority of vital industries being centrally run, the effects of bad management and corruption have reverberated down through the fabric of Venezuelan life. Unemployment has shot up, food is barely available and when it is the prices are a multiple of the average persons' monthly salary. Inflation has been eye-watering. The inflation rate at the end of January 2019 was 2.69 million percent (<a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi\">Trading Economics).</a> To put that into perspective using a more familiar currency, if you had $100,000 of savings when I first visited, that level of inflation would have reduced its value to 0.0037 of a cent by the time I returned. This is why it is so juxtaposed when you see families on the street in Bogotá. No one deserves to live without housing or food, of course. But homelessness is often sewn from the threads of addiction, broken families, illness or a lack of support network. What really hits home about this crisis is that the people in the street could be your family. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, children, grandparents and so on. The poverty is indiscriminate for these Venezuelans. You could have worked hard, saved money, bought a house and been the exemplary citizen and still seen your wealth turn to ash overnight. Even though it's made of bricks and mortar, the house you own is useless if there is no food in the country. Your career and social status mean nothing if your elderly parents die because they can't eat and can't get medical treatment in the empty, medicine-free hospitals of your country. When I first visited Cúcuta there were money changers in the street with piles of money as high as their waist next to them. This time they had resorted using the cash as fabric to make novel handbags.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c0ee94aec080f2d2fe57_family-arrival.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A family arrives with the only the possessions they can carry. For many this is the start of a long journey to countries such as Ecuador or Peru, often on foot</figcaption></figure><p>Not only would the economic dystopia be enough to drive you out but the administrative void left by the government is being filled by armed thugs. Venezuela is a narco-traffickers playground. Paramilitary groups have taken over swathes of land and 'collectivos' (armed pro-military groups) can do as they like as long as they help the incumbent government cling on to power.</p><p>‍So 'home' isn't great at the moment for what is normally the most patriotic nation I have met. When I arrived at Cúcuta in April 2018 I was shocked by the diversity of people arriving at the border. Old people who could barely walk. The handicapped. Heavily pregnant women who would prefer to have their babies on the streets of Colombia than risk their chances back home. A lady I spoke with at a church-lead food bank had given birth without any medical help just days before. Her tiny baby's first days being spent on humid, dirty streets with no prospect of change. That these people have opted to come here in these circumstances speaks gravely of the situation back in Venezuela.</p><p>‍Most arrive at the border with intentions of moving on further through Colombia or even on to other Latin American nations such as Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Most have to work selling sweets or begging to fund the onward journey making Cúcuta a scene of endless street sellers.</p><p>‍When I visited Cúcuta last year, the migration situation was more uncertain. Most Venezuelans have never had the need for a passport making it a fraught process to get the necessary papers to enter Colombia legally. Passports are very expensive compared to the average salary and with the government department in disarray, you either need to have a connection (and money for bribes) or wait years to receive one. Since my first visit, Colombia and many other Latin countries have started to allow passport-free travel and made it far easier to obtain papers to work. Fortunately, these Latino governments have learnt that this is their crisis as much as Venezuela's and are now doing their best to be accommodating (a little lesson in humanity that Western governments could learn from).</p><p>‍Despite all this plight, there are further nefarious forces at work. Some people I spoke to had been sold fake onward bus tickets putting them back to square one in both finances and morale. Many had been robbed by police or border guards on the way to Colombia who relieved them of anything expensive they had brought to sell once they arrived.</p><p>‍The fact that the Venezuelans continue to be such a warm, kind and positive people against this backdrop slightly restores your faltering faith in humanity. Coffee sellers laughed and joked with me whilst sat next to the money changer's waist-high piles of their effectively valueless currency.</p><p>‍Since my first visit, the situation in Venezuela has worsened markedly. It's estimated that now 2.7 million of the 32 million population have left Venezuela in search of survival (<a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/2-7-million-people-fled-venezuela-since-2015-154247595.html\">Yahoo</a>). Each day on the Transmilenio (the public transport system) in Bogotá, the tones of desperation in the voices of those families begging for coins increases. The saturation causes indifference. Desperation causes crime. Despite the Colombians being endlessly generous - each day you see extreme acts of kindness to strangers - the strain being put on their society is being felt. Stories of thefts and crime are increasingly being recounted with Venezuelan protagonists.</p><p>‍I returned to Cúcuta in late February 2019 for Venezuela Aid Live - a music festival organised by Richard Branson aimed to raise money for the Venezuelans and increasing awareness. The festival was interwoven with some interesting and divisive developments. Firstly, the Venezuelan politician Juan Guaidó was recently recognised as the de facto president by many foreign nations. Maduro however still holds the support of the military and therefore effective control of the country meaning that Guaidó's main aim is to promote defections and disobedience in their ranks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c1127c6bbd5640091704_signs.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Venezuelans holding signs asking for a 'Free Venezuela'</figcaption></figure><p>Also interestingly, the US has sent multiple shipments of aid, such as food and medicine, to supposedly help the suffering Venezuelans. This aid has become a political hot potato with many aid organisations distancing themselves from it through fear that it is a guise for US intervention. Maduro echoes these fears saying that the aid is a trojan horse for US imperialism and even said that it could contain armaments for anti-government operations. This is understandable as the US has got previous for this. The guy running the current aid operation was a key figure in the arming of anti-government forces in Guatemala in the '80s, an operation where they smuggled weapons in aid shipments.</p><p>‍Why Richard Branson was involved is beyond me. His roughly recorded festival video looked more like a hostage tape. His inability to pronounce Juan Guaidó's name (the person who supposedly invited him!) or the even the name of the town where the festival would be held made his link to the event look ceremonial.</p><p>‍In the run-up to the big day, the festival was looking like a political Fyre Festival. Festival organisers had not spoken to local governments even though they were organising a potentially 300 thousand person event in an area riddled with armed militant groups, shooting distance from a bridge blockaded by the Venezuelan national guard. What could go wrong?</p><p>‍As I arrived at the festival, I was relieved to see what seemed to be a well-organised event slowly filling up with happy and excited Venezuelans. For many, this marked a recognition of their suffering. A happy day of celebration against a backdrop of misery and a chance to highlight to the world that they needed help. Despite the unsettling foundations, the festival went ahead without hitch. However, the fragility of the situation was always present. At one point, a large group of people queuing to enter the festival suddenly turned around and ran, fleeing from some unseen disaster up ahead. Dylan and I joined and hid up a tree for safety from the stampede. After the panic had dissipated, it became apparent that it was triggered by a couple of people running normally and that everyone had seen this and assumed the worst. A happy outcome but one that highlighted the unease that everyone was feeling but not really showing.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c12d6188b760d94cea95_festival-view.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A view from the back of the festival</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c1457c6bbd366a091b55_festival-view-container.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>If you look closely you can see one of the shipping containers that Maduro's army put on the bridge, supposedly welding it to the floor and filling it with water.

Although they were having to do horrible, undignified jobs to survive now, they needed to keep their faith and know that the situation will get better. I will never forget this moment.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c2980beb2efc686734b6_sea-of-people.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A side view of the festival</figcaption></figure><p>If you measure success by its detractors then Branson pulled it off. Maduro, in a bid to hide how much the tide is turning against him, turned off Facebook, Google and other websites for the whole country so news of the event couldn't be shared.</p><p>‍The concert was part one of a two-part plan. The concert was going to show the world, those Venezuelans still in Venezuela and Maduro's loyal military just how many people have turned. It was designed to set the stage for part two - taking the aid into Venezuela the following day. The aid - which included enough rice to feed 2000 people for a month - was largely symbolic. Whilst it would help the populations of towns on the border for a little while, it wouldn't change much. However, to get the aid in the country, the Venezuelan military would need to go against Maduro's orders to allow it in. This would be the first step in what was - and still is - hoped to be the loosening of the control Maduro has over the only thing keeping him in power - his army.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c2d23b14d271749e7193_flowers-raised.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>I arrived at the main border bridge 'La Tienditas' at about 9 am on the Saturday morning to find a mobilising group of Venezuelans who had camped nearby the night before. The plan - implicitly backed by USAid, Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; and the presidents of supporting Latin nations - was for the Venezuelans to arm with white roses and then create a human chain to transport aid over the border. The hope was that the Venezuelan military would have to allow them through otherwise they would be stopping vital food and medicine reaching their starving family members and patriots. Seemingly no one had made plans for how to get around the three shipping containers that had been filled with water and welded to the floor to block the bridge.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c3200beb2eaae4673da6_left-over-flowers.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>About lunchtime, Dylan, the journalist and friend who I was with, had worked out that this bridge would be the scene of a largely ceremonial march and the actual aid would be taken to a nearby bridge 'La Parada'. We left for this bridge to arrive at a scene of chaos. Thousands of Venezuelans were on the bridge being hyped up by people microphones connected to trucks of speakers. The Venezuelan army and 'collectivos' (armed pro-government groups) blocked the border. At the front of the Venezuelan line was a row of armoured police shooting tear gas and rubber bullets and behind them, the collectivos were throwing rocks and later petrol bombs. All this before the actual aid had arrived.‍</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c34a7cba4105cb495f03_view-bridge.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>View from the side of the border bridge.

He replied, \"oh god\".‍</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c3a671734f0796840aff_aid-arriving.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Tear gas was being fired almost every 30 seconds which was normally shortly followed by medics carrying out people who couldn't breathe.

The vacuum of knowledge often triggering further panic. The hype men on the speaker trucks shouted at people not to run. They said that nothing could happen to you on Colombian soil, that the Venezuelan army couldn't do anything to you here. They shouted this from their comfy trucks, well hidden from any form of danger.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c3c13b14d241189e78bb_aid-on-bridge.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Aid trucks waiting on the start of the bridge.

Everyone, myself included, ran forward to see what was the source of the excitement thus increasing the excitement and so on. It was members of the Venezuelan military defecting. The excited crowds would lift the defector's arms in celebration as they were swept away by Colombian police to be processed. Often it was difficult to tell if the crowds want to kill or kiss the defectors given moments before they crossed the line from sworn enemy to ally.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c3d394aec09920d317ac_defector1.PNG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A defector from the Venezuelan army is escorted away from the crowds and into safety by Colombian police</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9e971d8733b57e0f5dc61a/5db9c3e77c6bbd8463092865_defector-close-up.PNG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Exhausted, the crowds hold his arm in the air</figcaption></figure><p>Later, watching the chaos unfold in a quiet spot next to the bridge, it seemed that there would be no end to this situation.

It's hard to say if the organisers achieved their plan as it's difficult to tell what that plan was. Members of Maduro's military - the thread holding him in power - did indeed defect.
